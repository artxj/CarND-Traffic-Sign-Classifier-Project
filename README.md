## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
The convolutional neural network is proposed to classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). Maximum validation accuracy was reached of 0.992, test accuracy is 0.981.

Writeup about the model can be found [here](./writeup.md).

Source code is in [Jupyter notebook](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb), HTML version is [here](./report.html).


### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

* [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The dataset should be unpacked in the folder ./traffic-signs-data
